        sites, transitioning the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript which helped
        align it with types in the core C# codebase increasing reliability and maintainability
        between frontend Vue.js sites and the backend .NET core
      </p>

      <p>
        Conceived and developed an <TextLink
          href="https://michaelwatts.me/work/split-payment-poc"
        >
          advanced admin portal
        </TextLink> as a POC for HMRC, integrating Elasticsearch and Kibana for database
        transactions, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards, and presenting
        updates to HMRC at Sprint Reviews.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built a secure admin portal using Vue and C# to streamline donor,
        donation, and charity management on the Swiftaid platform, allowing
        administrators full control to update, delete, adjust records, and
        correct information as needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implemented BDD practices by creating detailed Gherkin specs translated
        into unit tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prototyped applications and features with consideration for fundamental
        UX principles such as human-centered design, trust and error recovery.
        Translated concepts into finished products developed with JavaScript
        frontend framework such as Vue.js.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designed and implemented API specifications, addressed security
        vulnerabilities, automated deployment processes, created comprehensive
        unit tests, and generated clear documentation for all sites.
