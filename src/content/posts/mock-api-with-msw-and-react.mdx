  How to set up a mock API using MSW (Mock Service Worker) in a React application bootstrapped with Vite in your browser and testing environment.
</LeadParagraph>

Install the required dependencies:

<CodeBlock filename="Terminal">
```bash
npm install msw
```
</CodeBlock>

## Set up MSW for testing with Vitest

Add a **vitest.setup.ts** file to your project root, if not already present:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" filename="vitest.setup.ts">
```typescript
import { beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll } from "vitest";
import { server } from "./src/mocks/node";

beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen();
});

afterEach(() => {
  server.resetHandlers();
});

afterAll(() => {
  server.close();
});
```
</CodeBlock>

## Add your mock API handlers

Add a directory called **mocks** to your **src** directory.

In the **mocks** directory create a file called **browser.ts** and add the following code:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" filename="mocks/browser.ts">
```typescript
import { setupWorker } from "msw/browser";
import { handlers } from "./handlers.ts";

export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers);
```
</CodeBlock>


In the **mocks** directory create a file called **node.ts**, add the following:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" filename="mocks/node.ts">
```typescript
import { setupServer } from "msw/node";
import { handlers } from "./handlers.ts";

export const server = setupServer(...handlers);
```
</CodeBlock>

And in the **mocks** directory create a file called **handlers.ts** for your mock API handlers, for example I'm adding the following with a delay function to simulate network latency:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" filename="mocks/handlers.ts">
```typescript
import { http, delay, HttpResponse } from "msw";
import { type PaymentsResponse } from "../types";

export const handlers = [
  http.all('*', async () => {
    await delay(1000)
  }),
  http.get("https://api.example.com/user", () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({
      id: "abc-123",
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Maverick",
    });
  }),

  http.get("https://api.example.com/payments", () => {
    return HttpResponse.json<PaymentsResponse>({
      payments: [
        {
          id: "payment-1",
          customerName: "John Doe",
          date: "2025-08-05T05:34:33.231Z",
          amount: 100,
          status: "completed",
        },
        {
          id: "payment-2",
          customerName: "Jane Smith",
          date: "2025-09-06T05:34:33.231Z",
          amount: 200,
          status: "pending",
        },
        {
          id: "payment-3",
          customerName: "Alice Johnson",
          date: "2025-10-07T05:34:33.231Z",
          amount: 150,
          status: "failed",
        },
      ],
      metadata: {
        result_set: {
          count: 10,
          offset: 0,
          limit: 10,
          total: 3,
        },
      },
    });
  }),
];
```
</CodeBlock>

## Only enabled in development

In your **main.tsx** file, import and start the service worker _only_ in development mode.

See below:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" filename="main.tsx">
```typescript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";

async function enableMocking() {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development") {
    return;
  }

  const { worker } = await import("./mocks/browser.ts");

  return worker.start();
}

enableMocking().then(() => {
  createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
    <App />
  );
});
```
</CodeBlock>


## Add service worker to public directory

Finally, add the **mockServiceWorker.js** file to your public directory.

See https://mswjs.io/docs/integrations/browser/#generating-the-worker-script for instructions to copy the necessary service worker file into the public directory.

But basically it involves running the following command:

<CodeBlock filename="Terminal">
```bash
npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR> --save
```
</CodeBlock>

Where `<PUBLIC_DIR>` is the path to your public directory.
**mockServiceWorker.js** should now be in your public directory, no need to change it.

In **package.json** add the following configuration:

<CodeBlock lang="json" filename="package.json">
```json title="package.json"
//...existing
  "msw": {
    "workerDirectory": [
      "public"
    ]
  }
//...existing
```
</CodeBlock>

Now, during dev making any fetch requests to the URLs defined in your handlers will return the mock data.
