<LeadParagraph>
  CSS has long had the `attr()` function, but it's been limited to returning string values. The new typed `attr()` function changes this by allowing us to extract HTML attribute values and use them as proper CSS data types like numbers, colours, and lengths.

## How it works

The syntax is straightforward: `attr(attribute-name type, fallback)`. The type parameter tells CSS how to interpret the attribute value:

- `string` - the default, returns text
- `number` - parses numeric values
- `length` - interprets as CSS length units (px, em, etc.)
- `color` - parses colour values
- `url` - handles URL references

## Practical example

Instead of writing:

<CodeBlock filename="style.css">
```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```
</CodeBlock>

You can now define dimensions directly in HTML:

<CodeBlock filename="index.html">
```html
<div data-width="100" data-height="150"></div>
```
</CodeBlock>

And use them in CSS:

<CodeBlock filename="style.css">
```css
.element {
  width: attr(data-width px, 100px);
  height: attr(data-height px, 100px);
}
```
</CodeBlock>

This approach creates more dynamic, data-driven styling where HTML attributes control CSS properties. It's particularly useful for components that need varying dimensions or styling based on content.

## Browser support

Currently, browser support is limited, with only basic string support widely available. The typed variants are still experimental, but they represent an exciting direction for more flexible CSS styling.
