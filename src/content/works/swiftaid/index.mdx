## Swiftaid - an innovative SaaS product suite for charities and donors

<ContentSection>
  ### Introducing Swiftaid for charities and donors

  Swiftaid is a successful SaaS product recognised as a partner by HMRC and has helped claim back some of the £564 million in missed Gift Aid. Created by fintech startup Streeva,
  Swiftaid was designed to simplify the complex Gift Aid process for charities and donors.

  Starting from scratch, the engineering team helped grow the platform to support over eight million donors and more than a
  thousand charities and donation platforms, including household names such as JustGiving, Shelter and Comic Relief.

  Since launch, Swiftaid has processed over £250 million in eligible donations, automated Gift Aid claims worth an estimated £60 million in reclaimed tax for charities, and achieved
  a 97% user satisfaction rating across its partner platforms.

  Swiftaid's success is also demonstrated through its recognition by HMRC as the first solution to automate Gift Aid on contactless donations,
  its ability to help charities unlock millions in unclaimed Gift Aid, and its partnerships with major organisations
  like the Royal British Legion, Dogs Trust, and Crowdfunder.

  ### Providing account management tools for donors

  Throughout the life of the product the primary job of the engineering team was
  to design and develop new features. Features such as additional email, card
  and phone accounts meant that the product could support a more reliable method
  of matching donors to donations.

  ### Providing management tools for administrators

  A secure administration portal was developed to streamline donor, donation,
  and charity management on the Swiftaid platform, allowing administrators full
  control to update, delete, adjust records, and correct information as needed.
  While improving APIs, security, and deployment to support the small
  development team.

  ### Building brand trust, blogs and SEO

  One of the top-scoring search terms we saw for a while was "Is Swiftaid
  legit", which was a genuine and understandable concern given that the brand
  was relatively unknown. So building brand trust was a top priority.

  Consistent communication via email, social media, and blog articles helped
  improve Swiftaid's SEO rankings and strengthened users' confidence in the brand.
  Which was evidenced through search terms related to genuine questions around Gift Aid and charitable taxation and 
  customer outreach through our web sites.

  Presenting accurate content with clean design, a sprinkling of animation and a
  reliable and well-considered user experience helped reassure users that
  Swiftaid was a trustworthy company and that they were committed to best practices in handling
  and protecting personal data.
