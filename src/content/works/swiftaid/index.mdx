Streeva is a fintech company on a mission to make transactions smarter. One of its flagship products, Swiftaid, is already trusted by major organisations such as JustGiving, Shelter, and Comic Relief. By automating the complex process of claiming Gift Aid, Swiftaid enables charities to secure millions in additional funding, ensuring more resources can be directed towards their vital work.

When I joined the team, one of the key challenges was ensuring that Swiftaid could scale while maintaining reliability and compliance. The existing codebase relied heavily on JavaScript, which limited maintainability across a growing product suite. To address this, I led the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript, aligning the Vue.js applications with the C# backend services. This significantly improved both reliability and code quality, setting a stronger foundation for long-term growth.

As part of Streeva’s collaboration with HMRC, I conceived and delivered an advanced administrative portal as a proof of concept. This involved integrating Elasticsearch and Kibana to manage and analyse complex database transactions, while also ensuring that the system met strict accessibility standards. Throughout this process, I worked closely with HMRC stakeholders, presenting sprint reviews to demonstrate progress and shape the platform to their requirements.

Alongside this, I developed a secure portal using Vue and C# to give administrators greater transparency and control over donors, donations, and charity records. This system enabled staff to update, amend, or correct information with confidence, streamlining essential workflows and reducing the risk of errors. To further strengthen development practices, I introduced Behaviour-Driven Development through detailed Gherkin specifications, which were then translated into unit tests. This ensured that new features were delivered with consistency and a high degree of reliability.

I also worked on the early-stage prototyping of new applications and features using Figma, transforming design concepts into working products built with Vue and Preact. In addition, I helped design API specifications, identified and resolved security vulnerabilities, automated deployment processes, and documented systems to ensure they were easy to maintain and extend.

Together, these efforts not only improved the robustness of Swiftaid but also equipped the platform to scale securely and sustainably. The results of this work have directly contributed to Swiftaid’s ability to support charities in raising millions more through Gift Aid—demonstrating how technical innovation can deliver meaningful social impact.
