## Innovative fintech focused on making everyday transactions smarter

<div>
  At Streeva, I worked as part of a team on a financial SaaS Gift Aid platform
  called Swiftaid—that has grown to over 8 million users and used by thousands
  of charities and platforms including JustGiving, Shelter and Comic Relief—by
  moving the codebase to TypeScript, aligning Vue apps with C# services, and
  introducing BDD to boost reliability and facilitate scalability.
</div>

<div>
  With millions of donors on the platform scalability was important to get
  right. We also built a secure admin portal using Vue and C# to streamline
  donor, donation, and charity management on the Swiftaid platform, allowing
  administrators full control to update, delete, adjust records, and correct
  information as needed. while improving APIs, security, and deployment to
  support charities in raising more through Gift Aid.
