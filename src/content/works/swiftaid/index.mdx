Streeva is a fintech company focused on making everyday transactions smarter,
with its flagship product Swiftaid helping charities increase their Gift Aid
claims. Trusted by organisations such as JustGiving, Shelter, and Comic
Relief, Swiftaid streamlines a once complex process so that more funds can
reach the causes that need them most.

At Streeva, I worked on strengthening Swiftaid's foundations so the platform
could scale securely and reliably. This included moving the codebase from
JavaScript to TypeScript, aligning the Vue.js applications with the C#
services behind them. I also introduced Behaviour-Driven Development
practices, improving consistency and supporting the delivery of new features
with confidence.

Beyond Swiftaid, I helped design and deliver administrative portals, including
a proof of concept for HMRC with Elasticsearch and Kibana integration. I
contributed to secure systems that gave greater visibility over donor and
charity data, prototyped new products with Figma and Vue, supported API
design, and improved security and deployment processes. These efforts
strengthened the platform and helped create lasting value for the charities
Swiftaid supports.
