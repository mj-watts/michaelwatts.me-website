## Delivered and optimised ecommerce platforms with improved checkout conversion and integrating multiple payment gateways.

<div>
  I have supported the growth of several ecommerce platforms by combining
  reliable technical delivery with close client collaboration. My work focused
  on improving checkout experiences, ensuring platform stability, and enabling
  teams to manage their own sites with confidence.
</div>

<div>
  At Guitar Village, I enhanced the Ruby on Rails platform by integrating new
  features. Regular maintenance and performance improvements ensured the site
  stayed responsive and secure, while training sessions gave the client's team
  the ability to manage content and updates directly.
</div>

<div>
  For One Stop Grow Shop, I managed and developed the Spree Commerce site,
  adding crypto payment processing alongside their existing payment processor.
  These improvements expanded flexibility for customers.
</div>

<div>
  I have also worked with Shopify and WooCommerce as well as integrating Adyen,
  Stripe, PayPal, GoCardless and checkout.com into a number of projects.
