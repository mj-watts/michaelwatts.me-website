## Delivered and optimised e‑commerce platforms with improved checkout conversion and multi‑gateway payments

I have supported the growth of several e-commerce platforms by combining
reliable technical delivery with close client collaboration. My work focused
on improving checkout experiences, ensuring platform stability, and enabling
teams to manage their own sites with confidence.

At Guitar Village, I enhanced the Ruby on Rails platform by integrating secure
payment gateways such as Stripe and Sage Pay, creating a smoother checkout
process that helped increase customer conversions. Regular maintenance and
performance improvements ensured the site stayed responsive and secure, while
training sessions gave the client's team the ability to manage content and
updates directly.

For One Stop Grow Shop, I managed and developed the Spree Commerce site,
introducing multiple payment options including crypto alongside Stripe and
Checkout.com. These improvements expanded flexibility for customers and
streamlined transactions. I also applied this experience to Shopify and
WooCommerce projects, strengthening platform resilience and helping clients
sustain online sales growth.
