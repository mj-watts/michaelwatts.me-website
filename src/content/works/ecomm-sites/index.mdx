## Various tales from my ecommerce adventures.

I have supported the growth of several ecommerce platforms by combining
reliable technical delivery with close client collaboration. My work focused
on improving checkout experiences, ensuring platform stability, and enabling
teams to manage their own sites with confidence.

  ### Guitar Village ecommerce website

  At Guitar Village, I enhanced the Ruby on Rails platform by integrating new
  features. Regular maintenance and performance improvements ensured the site
  stayed responsive and secure, while training sessions gave the client's team
  the ability to manage content and updates directly.

  ### One Stop Grow Shop Ruby on Rails & Spree website

  For One Stop Grow Shop, I managed and developed the Spree Commerce site,
  adding crypto payment processing alongside their existing payment processor.
  These improvements expanded flexibility for customers.

  I also managed a remote team that handled some of the development of the site
  and met with and handled the client several times to bash out ideas, answer questions, support problems, etc.
