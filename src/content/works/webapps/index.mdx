## Rebuilt WWF Carbon Footprint Calculator with Vue, Laravel, and animation features

I helped deliver the 2018 relaunch of WWF's Carbon Footprint Calculator,
rebuilding the interface in Vue.js with a Laravel backend for data, CMS, and
integrations. The tool guided users through lifestyle questions, animated with
Anime.js for an engaging experience, and returned tailored recommendations to
reduce their impact. Close collaboration with WWF stakeholders ensured the
platform aligned with their goals and has since supported thousands in making
more sustainable choices.

## Sita Aero Logistics Calculator

For SITA Aero, I developed a web-based logistics calculator designed to
simplify the complex process of estimating aircraft shipping costs. Built with
AngularJS, this single-page application enabled users to configure
calculations based on weight, dimensions, destination, and service levels,
with results shown through real-time updates and ChartJS visualisations.
Authentication and user management were included, while data was securely
managed in Firebase to support scalability.

The project required close collaboration with SITA's logistics team to ensure
accuracy and usability. Dynamic forms and a clear interface made it practical
for teams to use, and I produced detailed technical documentation and user
guides to help adoption and training. The finished system provided a reliable
and user-friendly tool that improved efficiency in a highly specialised area
of logistics.
