## World Wildlife Fund

### Carbon Footprint Calculator

For the World Wildlife Fund, I worked on their Carbon Footprint Calculator, a
long-running web application designed to raise awareness of how everyday
choices impact the environment. Our 2018 version rebuilt the tool with a new
user interface using Vue.js, alongside a robust Laravel backend to handle data
processing, content management, and external integrations. The calculator
asked practical lifestyle questions on transport, energy, diet, and waste,
returning a measured footprint alongside personalised recommendations for
reducing impact.

This flexibility was made possible through a CMS that allowed WWF staff to
easily update data, questions, and advice without developer input, ensuring
relevance over time. I collaborated closely with WWF stakeholders through
feedback sessions and iterative releases to align functionality with their
goals. The result was a widely used tool that not only engaged users but also
supported WWF's mission to drive sustainable behaviour change at scale.

## Sita Aero

### Sita Aero Logistics Calculator

For SITA Aero, I developed a web-based logistics calculator designed to
simplify the complex process of estimating aircraft shipping costs. Built with
AngularJS, this single-page application enabled users to configure
calculations based on weight, dimensions, destination, and service levels,
with results shown through real-time updates and ChartJS visualisations.
Authentication and user management were included, while data was securely
managed in Firebase to support scalability.

The project required close collaboration with SITA's logistics team to ensure
accuracy and usability. Dynamic forms and a clear interface made it practical
for teams to use, and I produced detailed technical documentation and user
guides to help adoption and training. The finished system provided a reliable
and user-friendly tool that improved efficiency in a highly specialised area
of logistics.
