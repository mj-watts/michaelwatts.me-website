The [WWF Carbon Footprint Calculator](https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/) is a web application that allows users to calculate their personal carbon footprint based on various lifestyle factors. The project was developed for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) UK and aimed to raise awareness about individual contributions to climate change.

It has been an ongoing project since 2010, with significant updates and improvements made over the years. Our version was launched in 2018, featuring a complete overhaul of the user interface and experience.

The application is built using a combination of technologies, including **PHP** with the **Laravel framework for the backend**, and **Vue.js for the frontend**. The backend handles data processing, user management, and integration with external services, while the frontend provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.

The calculator covers various aspects of a user's lifestyle, including transportation, home energy use, food consumption, and waste management. Users can input their data through a series of questions, and the application calculates their carbon footprint based on established methodologies and data sources.

One of the key features of the WWF Carbon Footprint Calculator is its ability to provide personalized recommendations for reducing one's carbon footprint. After completing the questionnaire, users receive tailored suggestions on how to make more sustainable choices in their daily lives.

The project also includes a robust content management system (CMS) that allows WWF staff to easily update questions, answers, and recommendations without requiring technical expertise. This flexibility has been crucial for keeping the calculator relevant and up-to-date with the latest environmental data and trends.

Throughout the development process, I worked closely with WWF stakeholders to ensure that the application met their goals and requirements. This involved regular communication, feedback sessions, and iterative development to refine the user experience and functionality.

The WWF Carbon Footprint Calculator has been well-received by users and has contributed to raising awareness about climate change and the importance of individual actions. It continues to be a valuable tool for WWF in their mission to promote sustainability and environmental conservation.
