## Innovation proof of concept for HM Revenue & Customs

<ContentSection>
  ### An introduction to the Streeva Split Payment portal

  This was one of several innovation projects delivered by the engineering team at Streeva, 
  and the most notable to date, a £1.75M proof of concept for HM Revenue & Customs. 
  The project demonstrated the ability to process and enrich transaction data in real time, and tested to 
  handle millions of records with low latency and a scalable infrastructure that was designed to meet processing
  requirements set by HMRC's technical team.

  ### Prototyping in Figma, building with TypeScript

  Designed and prototyped in Figma, built using Vue, TypeScript, Elasticsearch, Kibana and Node.
  
  Also developed mock merchant stores and integrated test payment solutions such as Stripe and Checkout.com with Streeva's data overlay network to demonstrate
  the transaction processing element.

  Regular presentations in sprint reviews to HMRC were well received, with our work recognised for its transparency and innovation.

  Working with BDD through Gherkin and Vitest, I helped ensure reliable feature
  delivery, while regular sprint reviews with HMRC shaped the system to their
  strict accessibility and performance needs.
