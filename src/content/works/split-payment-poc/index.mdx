## Developed secure proof-of-concept administrative portal for HMRC

<div>
  I helped design and deliver an HMRC proof-of-concept portal that securely
  handled large-scale transactional data, using Elasticsearch and Kibana for
  advanced search and visualisation.
</div>

<div>
  Working with BDD through Gherkin and Vitest, I ensured reliable feature
  delivery, while regular sprint reviews with HMRC shaped the system to their
  strict accessibility and performance needs.
