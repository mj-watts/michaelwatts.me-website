As part of Streeva’s collaboration with HMRC, I played a key role in conceiving and developing an advanced administrative portal as a proof of concept. The goal was to create a system capable of securely handling and querying large volumes of transactional data. To achieve this, I integrated Elasticsearch and Kibana, enabling powerful indexing, searching, and visualisation of the database backend.

A crucial aspect of this project was ensuring transparency and demonstrating progress in line with HMRC’s technical requirements. I regularly presented the portal to HMRC’s technical review team during Sprint Reviews, showcasing new functionality, gathering feedback, and refining the system to meet their needs. This close collaboration ensured the solution not only addressed complex data challenges but also aligned with HMRC’s expectations for compliance and performance.

We worked with Gherkin specifications to define behaviour-driven development (BDD) scenarios, which were then translated into unit tests using Vitest. This approach ensured that new features were delivered with consistency and reliability, reducing the risk of regressions and enhancing overall code quality.

The data is filtered using Elasticsearch, allowing for efficient querying and analysis.
