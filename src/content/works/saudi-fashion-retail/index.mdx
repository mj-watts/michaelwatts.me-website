The platform featured a custom content management system built on **ExpressionEngine**, which enabled editors to easily create and manage articles, images, and multimedia content.

Responsive design principles were applied to ensure optimal viewing across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The website fully supported both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) text directions, catering to Arabic-speaking audiences, and an Arabic version of the site was produced with local content and editors.

Social media sharing features were integrated to enhance user engagement and content dissemination.

Custom plugins and modules were developed to extend the functionality of the CMS, including advanced search capabilities and user comment systems.

Website performance was optimised through efficient coding practices and database management using **MySQL** and **NoSQL** databases.

Collaboration with a team of designers and content creators ensured a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.

User testing was conducted and feedback was implemented to continuously improve the website's usability and functionality.

Website security and data protection were maintained through regular updates and monitoring.

The project was completed on time and within budget, resulting in a successful launch and positive user reception.

A team of content creators, editors, and developers in Saudi Arabia (onsite and remotely) was managed to ensure smooth project execution and delivery.

Alongside the website, several social media games were developed for Gap Inc., Marks & Spencer, and other high street brands to increase user engagement and brand awareness, utilising platforms like Facebook to reach a wider audience.
