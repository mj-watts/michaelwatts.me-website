This project centred on building a dynamic content platform using
ExpressionEngine, giving editors the flexibility to easily create and manage
articles, images, and multimedia assets. The site was designed responsively to
ensure a great experience across desktops, tablets, and mobiles, and was
launched with full support for both left-to-right and right-to-left text,
including an Arabic edition managed by local editors.

To enhance engagement, features such as social media sharing, advanced search,
and user comments were developed through custom plugins and modules.
Performance was optimised by applying efficient coding and database management
techniques, while security and data protection were maintained through regular
updates and monitoring. Close collaboration with designers and content teams
helped deliver a visually consistent and user-friendly platform, supported by
ongoing testing and feedback.

Alongside this, I oversaw content teams both onsite and remotely in Saudi
Arabia to ensure smooth delivery. The project was launched successfully, on
time and to budget, with a positive reception from users. In parallel, I also
helped develop a series of social media games for brands such as Gap Inc. and
Marks & Spencer, designed to drive awareness and user interaction through
platforms like Facebook.
