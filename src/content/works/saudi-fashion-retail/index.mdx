## Delivered multilingual content platform with custom features and social media brand campaigns

<div>
  This project focused on developing a flexible content platform with
  ExpressionEngine, enabling editors to easily manage articles, images, and
  multimedia. The site was fully responsive across devices and supported both
  left-to-right and right-to-left text, including an Arabic edition written by
  content creators and editors based in Saudi.
</div>

<div>
  To improve engagement, I created custom plugins for social sharing, advanced
  search, and user comments, while also optimising performance with efficient
  coding and database management. Security and data protection were priorities,
  kept up to date through regular monitoring. Working closely with designers and
  content teams, the platform achieved a consistent, user-friendly experience,
  refined further through testing and feedback.
</div>

<div>
  I also managed a content team in Saudi Arabia to ensure smooth delivery of
  articles and imagery. The site launched successfully, on schedule and to
  budget, receiving positive user feedback. Alongside this, I developed social
  media games for major retail brands such as Gap Inc. and Marks & Spencer,
  designed to increase awareness and interaction on platforms like Facebook.
