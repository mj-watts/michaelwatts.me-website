IO Music App was built using a combination of **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development, **Objective-C** for native iOS components, and **Firebase** for backend services including real-time database and authentication. **Redis** was used for caching to enhance performance and scalability.

The app's standout feature was its **party mode**, which allowed users to create shared playlists and collaboratively control music playback in real-time. This feature was implemented using WebSockets to ensure low-latency communication between users.

The app also included standard music streaming features such as personalized recommendations, offline listening, and social sharing. Users could follow friends, share playlists, and discover new music through curated content.

Throughout the development process, I worked closely with designers and product managers to ensure a seamless user experience. This involved iterative testing and feedback sessions to refine the app's functionality and interface.

The app was successfully launched on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, receiving positive reviews for its innovative features and user-friendly design. It quickly gained traction in the market, reaching the top 10 in the Apple charts and achieving over 100,000 downloads in its first month.

The project also involved ongoing maintenance and updates to introduce new features, fix bugs, and improve performance based on user feedback. This ensured that the app remained competitive in the rapidly evolving music streaming market.

Overall, the development of the IO Music app was a successful endeavor that showcased the potential of combining modern technologies to create a unique and engaging music streaming experience.
