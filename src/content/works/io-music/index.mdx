  ### Introducing ioMusic

  An iOS native application called IO Music was a free music video streaming app reached the top 10 in the Apple charts and gained
  100,000+ downloads in its first month, gaining very positive reviews. It proved that you don't need a big team to build good things, fast. 
  It was later transitioned to Android (thanks to React Native) and also launched on the Google Store.

  ### Hackathon MVP developed into full product

  Stemming from an idea, that later, as part of a company hackathon, was built into a working MVP in Rails, users could remotely control a web application from their PCs
  and queue up tracks and videos using YouTube's API on an office TV, it provided a lot of fun (and distraction) for the office and started the seed of an idea that
  something this fun and popular could perhaps generate revenue.

  Originally powered by Ruby on Rails application, WebSockets a PostgreSQL database, and a React frontend, some elements of the
  web application were adapted and developed into a native mobile app built with React Native and supported by RabbitMQ message queues and a Firebase database.

  ### Curated content and social media to build interest

  A constant social media campaign leveraging inhouse design from our award winning designer built interest in the product even before release.

  Content and playlists were carefully curated by the team alongside standard features like recommendations and social sharing built up a good stream of interesting posts about the app.

  ### A good reach but a not so great revenue stream

  ioMusic reached the top 10 in the Apple charts and gained
  100,000+ downloads in its first month, earning positive reviews for both its
  innovative functionality and user-friendly design.

  With some paywalled premium features we generated revenue from premium subscribers and plus advertising. 

  The amount of money generated from advertising was not as much as was hoped.
